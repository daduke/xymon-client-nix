#nix package for xymon-client

##Credits

This is based on [Pierre's](https://plmlab.math.cnrs.fr/nix/xymon-client) nix package for xymon-client. He did the initial work to compile the xymon sources. I added everything else to get the client up and running under NixOS.

##Building

`nix build .#xymon-client`
